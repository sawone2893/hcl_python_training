Docstrings (__doc__)
 
              To explain the code/documentation generation against some function.
 
             
 
              def func():
 
    """"This is a sample file"""
 
    print('Hello Python')
 
              print(func.__doc__)
 
 
How Python Sees Variables
 
              In python, the variable is not a named memory location.
 
              variable is just a reference to a memory area. Every value is a new memory area.
 
              a = 20
 
              a = 23 #location changes
 
              variable don't have types, but the objects in memory they refer has types.
 
 
Datatypes in Python
 
              Dynamically typed language, No need to explicitly declare the variable
 
              Still you could typecast using the keywords for datatypes.
 
 
Built-in datatypes
 
              int, float, complex, str, list, tuple, range, dict, set, frozenset, bool, NoneType, bytes, bytearray, memoryview
 
bool Datatype
 
              subclass of int only (True = 1, False = 0)
 
Sequences in Python
 
              Ordered collection of items.
 
              str (Strings): Immutable sequence of characters, used for text.
 
 
              list (Lists): Mutable ordered collection of items, enclosed in square brackets [].
 
 
              tuple (Tuples): Immutable ordered collection of items, enclosed in parentheses ().
 
 
              range (Range objects): Immutable sequence of numbers, typically used for looping a specific number of times.
 
              For example range(5) - generates numbers from 0 to 4.
 
             
 
Sets
 
              A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique and immutable items
 
              define using the curly braces {}
 
              s = {1,2,1,2,4,1,15} # what it will print?
 
              All mathematical operations could be done which are done on set - Union/Intersection/difference/symmetric difference (A-B) UNION (B-A)
 
 
Literals in Python
 
              In Python, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in the source code. Essentially, they are the raw data values that you directly write into your program. String literals, boolean, integer, tuple, list, etc.
 
 
Determining the Datatype of a Variable
 
              using the type function.
 
 
What about Characters
 
              string of length 1.
 
              ord and chr functions.
 
              Unicode character - A character which takes more than 1 byte - usually 4 Bytes
 
              print the ascii value.
 
             
 
User-defined Datatypes
 
              Use classes to define your own data type. Will see how to define them
 
             
 
Constants in Python
 
              ALL CAPITAL LETTERS in variable name. Like - PI_VAL = 3.14.
 
              Please note, it's Only for readability. It's not like you can't change the value.
 
             
 
Identifiers and Reserved words
 
              False, None, True, and, as, assert, async, await, break, class, continue, def, del, elif, else, except, finally, for, from, global, if, import, in, is, lambda, nonlocal, not, or, pass, raise, return, try, while, with, yield

Naming Conventions in Python (Basically the guidelines for declaring the variable/function/module/file names:
 
              Python naming conventions are a set of guidelines, primarily outlined in PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8), that aim to make Python code more readable, consistent, and maintainable. Following these conventions is crucial for collaborative projects and for writing "Pythonic" code.
 
 
              Here's a breakdown of the key naming conventions:
 
 
              *General Principles:
 
 
              Readability: Names should be easy to read and understand.
 
 
              Meaningful: Names should clearly indicate their purpose or content.
 
 
              Consistency: Stick to a chosen convention throughout your codebase.
 
 
              *Common Naming Styles and Their Usage:
 
 
              *lowercase_with_underscores (snake_case):
 
 
              Purpose: The most common style in Python. Words are separated by underscores.
 
 
              Used For:
 
 
              Functions: calculate_total_price(), get_user_data()
 
 
              Variables: user_name, total_count, is_active
 
 
              Modules (Python files): my_module.py, data_processor.py
 
 
              Packages (directories containing modules): my_package/, utilities/
 
 
              *CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE):
 
 
              Purpose: Indicates that a variable is a constant, usually defined at the module level. Its value should not change during the program's execution.
 
 
              Used For:
 
 
              Constants: MAX_CONNECTIONS, PI_VALUE, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT
 
 
              *CamelCase (CapWords / PascalCase):
 
 
              Purpose: Each word starts with a capital letter, with no underscores.
 
 
              Used For:
 
 
              Class Names: MyClass, UserManager, Car
 
 
              *Exception Names: MyCustomError, FileNotFoundError
 
 
              *_single_leading_underscore (Internal Use Indicator):
 
 
              Purpose: A convention (not enforced by the interpreter) to indicate that a variable, function, or method is intended for "internal use" within a module or class. It's a hint to other developers not to access it directly from outside.
 
 
              Used For: _internal_variable, _helper_function()
 
 
              *__double_leading_underscore (Name Mangling):
 
 
              Purpose: Triggers "name mangling" within a class to prevent name clashes in subclasses. The Python interpreter internally renames the attribute (e.g., __private_var becomes _ClassName__private_var).
 
 
              Used For: Attributes intended to be "private" to a class (though still technically accessible). __secret_data
 
 
              *__double_leading_and_trailing_underscores__ (Dunder / Magic Methods):
 
 
              Purpose: These are special methods and attributes defined by Python itself. They have specific, predefined meanings for the interpreter. Never invent your own names in this style.
 
 
              Used For: __init__, __str__, __add__, __len__
 
 
              *Specific Recommendations:
 
 
              Avoid single-character names: Except for simple loop counters (i, j, k), mathematical variables (x, y, z), or very short-lived temporary variables.
 
 
              Avoid built-in names: Do not use names that clash with Python's built-in functions or types (e.g., list, str, id, sum) as this can lead to unexpected behavior.
 
 
              Boolean names: Start with is_, has_, can_ (e.g., is_empty, has_permissions).
 
 
              Abbreviations: Avoid excessive or ambiguous abbreviations. Clarity is preferred.
 
 
              By consistently applying these naming conventions, you contribute to code that is easier to read, understand, and maintain for anyone working with it, including yourself in the future.
